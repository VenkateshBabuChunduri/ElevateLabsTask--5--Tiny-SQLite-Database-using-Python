# ElevateLabsTask--5--Tiny-SQLite-Database-using-Python
Use SQL inside Python to pull simple sales info (like total quantity sold, total revenue), and display it using basic print statements and a simple bar chart. 

# 🧾 Task 7 – Basic Sales Summary using SQL in Python

This project is part of my **Data Analyst Internship**. The goal is to create a simple SQLite database, run SQL queries inside Python, summarize sales data, and visualize results with a bar chart.

---

## ✅ Key Steps
- 🔹 Created a SQLite database (`sales_data.db`)
- 🔹 Inserted sample sales data (product, quantity, price)
- 🔹 Ran SQL queries to calculate:
  - Total quantity and revenue per product
  - Top-selling product by revenue
  - Overall total sales (quantity and revenue)
- 🔹 Loaded SQL results into a pandas DataFrame
- 🔹 Plotted a bar chart showing revenue by product

## 📊 Insights
- 🍎 **Apples** generated the highest revenue among all products, making it the top-selling item.
- 💰 The **total revenue** from all products was **`117.8`**, with a **total quantity sold of `66`**
- 📈 Visualizing sales makes it easier to identify top-performing products — helpful for business decisions like inventory planning or marketing focus.
